# Habit tracker

### Description
Console CRUD application developed using C# and SQLite. 

### Requirements
- [x] Application where you’ll log occurrences of a habit.
- [x] Habit can't be tracked by time (ex. hours of sleep), only by quantity (ex. number of water glasses a day)
- [x] Users need to be able to input the date of the occurrence of the habit
- [x] The application should store and retrieve data from a real database
- [x] When the application starts, it should create a sqlite database, if one isn’t present.
- [x] It should also create a table in the database, where the habit will be logged.
- [x] The users should be able to insert, delete, update and view their logged habit.
- [x] You should handle all possible errors so that the application never crashes.
- [x] You can only interact with the database using ADO.NET. You can’t use mappers such as Entity Framework or Dapper.
- [x] Follow the DRY Principle, and avoid code repetition.

### Features
-  **CRUD** App with one table
- Utilization of SQLite
- Operating on DateTime format
- Format validation

### Challenges
- First time ever working directly on database. I had to learn how to use SQL and how to perform operations on database.
- I had problems with project structure.

### Areas to improve
- Project structure and OOP

# Console | Habit-Tracker

This application is a console based CRUD application used to track multiple hobbies
including the date and a speciifed measurement.

Got guided by pablo from c#academy on Sqlite and also did the
first challenge provided on the website.

## Features:

- ADO.NET
- The application lets you create a habit which creates a table for that habit.
- This application lets you track multiple hobbies of your own choice with your own measurements
- User can navigate through the ui with the keyboard
- The user can insert,read,update and delete records from a database
- Users input is validated

## Challenges:

- It was a little challenging understanding the sqlite syntax but i think i might 
make the app again when i have spare time to learn the syntax fully
- Making the user able to add more hobbies and also view the other hobbies was challenging
because of not knowing how to show tables
- Had validation issues which i fixed before publishing the app
- Made classes that makes the code tidy but im not sure if its spaghetti code yet :D

## Lessons Learned:
- How to use sqlite to make databases,do CRUD commands,show tables etc.
- Reinforced my knowledge on C# 
- Reinforced my validation knowledge
- Reinforced my knowledge on classes and how to make code more tidy

    HabitDefs: table containing different types of habits that the user can log
    HabitLogs: table containing actual habits and their values

- [x] Outline menu

- [x] Implement AskMenuOption()
- [x] Implement "Add new habit definition"
- [x] Implement "[DEBUG] Fill habitlogs with random entries"
- [x] Implement "View all entries"
- [x] Implement "Log new entry"
- [x] Implement "Edit existing entry"
- [x] Implement "Remove entry"
- [x] Implement "Edit existing definition"
- [] Implement "Remove definition"
- [] Implement "See statistics"

    Ideas for habits:
        - Glasses of water (times)
        - Cycling (km)
        - Running (km)
        - Stretching (minutes)
    
    Ideas for queries:
        - How many times + Total + Average per week/month/year
        - Top 3 days/months with most
        - Day with least
        - Largest day gap
        - Current daily streak + Longest daily streak

Ideas for future projects:
- Edit/Remove functionality could be accessed within a "Modify" option.
- Every item inside the db could have an unique 'guid'
- Items could be selected simply via guid number.
- For removal, accept bulk (x, y, z...)

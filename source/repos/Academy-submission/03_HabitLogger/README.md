# üìã Habit Logger

A console app that helps the user to track and log habits that can be measured.

Inspired by the [C# Academy Habit Logger Project]([https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/project/11/calculator](https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/project/12/habit-logger)).

# üß† Key concepts

- Modular structure following **clean architecture** and **composition laws**
- Separation of concerns: UI (`App`), logic (`Services`), data (`Data`)
- Input validation using helper methods
- ADO.NET database interactions with **parameterized queries** (no Entity Framework)
- Auto-seeded database

C# Academy Console Project #3.


This is my Habit Logger for the C# Academy Console proejct #3. 

The priority right now is to complete all projects. Upon completion of all projects, I will revisit to complete the "challenges" in the near future to dig deeper. 





## Requirements

- This is an application where you’ll register one habit.

- This habit can't be tracked by time (ex. hours of sleep), only by quantity (ex. number of water glasses a day)
- The application should store and retrieve data from a real database
- When the application starts, it should create a sqlite database, if one isn’t present.
- It should also create a table in the database, where the habit will be logged.
- The app should show the user a menu of options.
- The users should be able to insert, delete, update and view their logged habit.
- You should handle all possible errors so that the application never crashes.
- The application should only be terminated when the user inserts 0.
- You can only interact with the database using raw SQL. You can’t use mappers such as Entity Framework.
- Your project needs to contain a Read Me file where you'll explain how your app works. Here's a nice example:

## Challenges

- Let the users create their own habits to track. That will require that you let them choose the unit of measurement of each habit.
- Seed Data into the database automatically when the database gets created for the first time, generating a few habits and inserting a hundred records with randomly generated values. This is specially helpful during development so you don't have to reinsert data every time you create the database.

- Create a report functionality where the users can view specific information (i.e. how many times the user ran in a year? how many kms?) SQL allows you to ask very interesting things from your database.
## Room For Improvement


- Learn how to make a better readMe
- Dive into the challenges in the near future
- Learn more about SQLite

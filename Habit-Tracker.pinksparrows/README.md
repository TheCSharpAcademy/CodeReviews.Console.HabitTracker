# Habit-Tracker
This is a project I did specifically starting from scratch, no starter guide and just googling/asking questions.

For this reason, the code is most likely very rough and messy and not well-optimized.

However, what I got out of doing this project is more than worth it to me. I enjoyed every second.

# Requirements

- [x] This is an application where you’ll register one habit.
- [x] This habit can't be tracked by time (ex. hours of sleep), only by quantity (ex. number of water glasses a day)
- [x] The application should store and retrieve data from a real database
- [x] When the application starts, it should create a sqlite database, if one isn’t present.
- [x] It should also create a table in the database, where the habit will be logged.
- [x] The app should show the user a menu of options.
- [x] The users should be able to insert, delete, update and view their logged habit.
- [x] You should handle all possible errors so that the application never crashes.
- [x] The application should only be terminated when the user inserts 0.
- [x] You can only interact with the database using raw SQL. You can’t use mappers such as Entity Framework.


# Funcion of the Console App

- The function of this application is to register, delete, update, or view a habit using SQLite to manage the database. 
- The objective for me was to put together a project that is beyond my scope of knowledge and research/learn my way through it until the objectives were met.

# Challenges

- This was outside of my comfort zone as this was the first time I truly learned by just coding and googling as I go.
- I've never really used SQLite and had very limited knowledge in databases (I took a college class learning SQL completely separate from code).
- Learning how and when to commit, I still forget sometimes and had to make up for some things when I didn't properly save.
- Learning how to put things into separate methods to make it easier was a huge challenge
- I messed around a lot with error checking and statements

# Areas to improve

- I could really use the debugger more often, I think overall it could have helped me a lot more when it comes to error checking
- I think sorting my code and cleaning it up was definitely not up to par, and I could learn more about that
- I want to explore SQL a lot more as the commands are still a bit vague to me.
- Consistency. Consistency. Consistency. Found myself taking more breaks than wanted and some days off.
- Realistically this project (had I started now) could have taken just a few days if not less.

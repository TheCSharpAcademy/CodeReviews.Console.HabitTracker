### Habit Tracker App

Info
C# Academy project that uses SQLite to track a single habit.
The habit I chose is doing situps.
On starting, the app creates a database called "HabitDatabase"
Displays menu that lets user View, Create, Delete or Update an entry.
From the main menu user can input "0" to close the application.
From a submenu user can input "0" to return to main menu.
The app is controlled fully with number inputs from the user.
All inputs are checked to ensure that they fit the correct format/values.

Notes
I didn't do any of the challenges for this project,
had a lot of trouble with the base requirements already.
I want to revisit this soon and see if I can implement the challenges.

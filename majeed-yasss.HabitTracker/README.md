## Confession

I have a confession to make: I cheated ðŸ˜…  
While I was already familiar with SQLite, this was my first time working with ADO.NET. At first, I found it verbose and a bit confusingâ€”especially the repetitive cycle of opening connections, creating commands, executing them, and then closing everything properly.

So, I followed the [official tutorial](https://youtu.be/d1JIJdDVFjs) and then expanded upon it with my own additions.

## Improvements to the Original Project

- The original project was implemented entirely in a single class; I refactored it using a more OOP/MVC-inspired approach.
- I incorporated the **Spectre.Console** library (yes, I peeked ahead at the next project ðŸ˜„).
- I used **parameterized queries** (which was one of the given challenges).
- I implemented a **data seeding** function that populates the database automatically when itâ€™s created for the first time (also a challenge goal).

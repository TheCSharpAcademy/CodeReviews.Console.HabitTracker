# Habit Tracker
Console based CRUD application to register multiple habits. Developed using C# and SQLite.

# Features
-The program stores and reads information through an SQLite db connection.
-Users can navigate a console based UI via key inputs.
-Users are able to create their own habits to track as well as the units by which to measure the habit (i.e. hours, minutes, miles, etc). They can also read, delete, or update those entries.
-A one-to-one relationship is used to relate the user habits and the habit unit to the date the habit was logged and the quantity of the unit in another table.
-Seed Data is automatically generated when the database gets created for the first time.

# Add Later
Create a report functionality where the users can view specific information (i.e. how many times the user ran in a year? how many kms?).

# HabitTracker

An application that helps users develop a habit by allowing them to
easily log and track their behaviour.

## Features

### Create Habit Log

- Users can create logs by entering quantity of habit (numerical value)
  and the time at which they did the activity aka log time.

### Display Habit Logs

- Display all created logs.

### Update Logs

- Users can update a habit log by habit ID (can be found when viewing logs)

### Delete Logs

- Users can delete a habit log by habit ID (can be found when viewing logs)

## Run Locally (Development)

To run this locally,he application can be run locally via command line:

- Clone this repository
- `cd HabitTrackerProgram`
- `dotnet run`

## Tech Stack

- This C# console application uses ADO.NET to connect to an SQLite database.
- When the application starts, it should create a sqlite database,
  if one isnâ€™t present.
- It should also create a table in the database, where the habit
  will be logged.

## Code Organization

The source code has been organized into various modules/namespaces to
maintain separation of concerns:

### `HabitTrackerProgram/Program.cs`

- Entrypoint

### `HabitTrackerProgram/Database`

- Contains a `Connection` class to manage SQLite connection.
- `HabitLogRepository` to query the database for habit logs.

### `HabitTrackerProgram/Model`

- Contains the `HabitLog` model which encapsulates the data and
  business logic related to a habit log.

### `HabitTrackerProgram/Util`

- Contains convenient utilities to allow code reuse across the application.

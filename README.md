# Console.HabitTracker
This is a program to record the number of glasses of water you drink on a certain date.

## Motivation
I completed this program following the guidance of THE C# ACADEMY. I enjoy learning and coding in the C# language.
Although I have some experience, I follow the sequence of challenges and discover new tools.

## Requeriments
You need to add the Nuget package Microsoft.Data.Sqlite.

## Warning
Don't confuse it with another package called Microsoft.Data.Sqlite.Core because it won't work well for you.

## How to use it
You can enter, modify, delete and view the records that are stored in a SQLite database.
Enter the date in dd-MM-yy format and the number of glasses of water that were drunk that day.
You can return to the main menu by entering the letter "R" and exit the program by entering the letter "Q".

# Habit logger
Tracks any custom habits by name, quantity, measurement and date. Habits are
possible to create, delete and update. There is also a summary option available to see complete summary of a habit.

## Features
* Tracking custom habits by name, measurement, quantity and date
* Habits are saved in a Sqlite Database and a single table
* Possible to Insert, Delete and Update a habit in Database
* Generation of 10 random habits
* Summary of a single habit

## Reflecting on Progress and Insights Gained

* Application does not follow any Design Patterns. Single Responsibility Principle would have mitigated code duplication
* Managing code within single file becomes challenging as the number of lines grows
* Minimal if any Object Oriented design principles were applied in an OOP language
* Having Two tables one for habits and other for habit records would have provided better organizational structure
* Use of unit testing should be implemented as the application cannot be properly testing manually due to boredom

Math Game
1. You need to create a Math game containing the 4 basic operations
2.  The divisions should result on INTEGERS ONLY and dividends should go from 0 to 100. Example: Your app shouldn't present the division 7/2 to the user, since it doesn't result in an integer.
3.  Users should be presented with a menu to choose an operation
4.  You should record previous games in a List and there should be an option in the menu for the user to visualize a history of previous games. You don't need to record results on a database. Once the program is closed the results will be deleted.

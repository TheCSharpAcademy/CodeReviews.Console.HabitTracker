habit tracking app for c# practice



i tried to architecture it correctly thanks to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/microservice-ddd-cqrs-patterns/ddd-oriented-microservice



i didn't expect this to take so long but i genuinely had a lot of fun doing it, even if it was a bit simple



i have to strengthen my understanding of entity objects and dtos - this is a simple example so i don't think the distinction is useful in this case, which might have actually led to a great deal of confusion trying to implement patterns that are not necessary

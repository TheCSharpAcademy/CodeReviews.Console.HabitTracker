# Console.HabitTracker
This is a program to record the number of glasses of water you drink on a certain date.

## Motivation
I completed this program following the guidance of THE C# ACADEMY. I enjoy learning and coding in the C# language.
Although I have some experience, I follow the sequence of challenges and discover new tools.

## How to use it
You can enter, modify, delete and view the records that are stored in a SQLite database.
Enter the date in dd-MM-yy format and the number of glasses of water that were drunk that day.
You can return to the main menu by pressing the "R" key.

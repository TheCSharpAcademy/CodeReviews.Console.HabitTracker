My first C# application, and first time using Visual Studio.

Console based CRUD application to track time spent coding. Developed using C# and SQLite.

The user is able to input new rows for how often they have coded for the day. You are also able to update or delete these records if you so choose. In addition, if you'd like to wipe the entire database, go for it, but be careful!

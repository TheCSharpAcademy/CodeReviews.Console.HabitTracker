# Console HabitTracker
  My Second C# Application. Made using Visual Studio and VScode
  Basic CRUD Application using C# and SQLite3
# Given Requirments:
  * This is an application where you’ll register one habit.
  * This habit can't be tracked by time (ex. hours of sleep), only by quantity (ex. number of water glasses a day)
  * The application should store and retrieve data from a real database
  * When the application starts, it should create a sqlite database, if one isn’t present.
  * It should also create a table in the database, where the habit will be logged.
  * The app should show the user a menu of options.
  * The users should be able to insert, delete, update and view their logged habit.
  * You should handle all possible errors so that the application never crashes.
  * The application should only be terminated when the user inserts 0.
  * You can only interact with the database using raw SQL. You can’t use mappers such as Entity Framework.
  * Your project needs to contain a Read Me file where you'll explain how your app works. Here's a nice example:

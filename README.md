# Console.HabitTracker by fdv

## My Project for creating a habit tracker in C#.  When you start the program, you can add, delete, update, or view habits and there quantities.

### How to use
* There are 50 values randomly added to the database when it is created.
* You can track multiple habits, I'm trying to decide if it should be limited or add an option to Add a habit and unit of measurement.
* You can add a new habit, update an existing habit, or delete one.

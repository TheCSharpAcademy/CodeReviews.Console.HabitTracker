# Habit Tracker

An application i built to follow along the the C# Academy roadmap (which I highly recommend by the way). The application is console based and does CRUD operations to track the 
water drinking habit. Developed using C# and SQLite.

## Requirements
- Log the occurences of a habit
- Must track the quantity only, not the time
- Users need to be able to input the date of the occurrence of the habit
- The application must use a real database and create one incase it does not already exist
- The user should be able to insert, delete, update and view the logged habits
- Must handle exceptions to not let application crash
- Must use ADO.NET
- Must follow the DRY Principle
- Must contain a Read Me file.

## Features
- SQLite database connection. The database is created on startup if it does not already exist
- A console that serves as the UI
- All CRUD operations

## Challenges
After completing all the requirements on the roadmap before this project, it was not too complex of a challenge. However, it was still necessary to be very attentive to details such as
 validation rules and exception handling, which is time consuming. Since I was really eager to move on, I ended up only completing the basic requirements and ignored the challenges for this 
 project.

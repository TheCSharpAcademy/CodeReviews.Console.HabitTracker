FEATURES:

-SQLite Database:

This application uses a SQLite database to store and read information.

There are 3 default databases that will be created at the beginning: Track Drinking Water; Track Running Count and Track Programming learning hours.

There is 1 option to create a new custom tracker, and the option to track all custom items you create.

-Navigation:

You need to use the keys to navigate through the different menus or functions. 

-CRUD DB functions:

You can set a date in format (dd-MM-yyyy) and a measurement value for each habit you want to track. 

You can create new habits to track and also create the measurement value.

There are different options: View all records (you will see the id number, date and measure value); Insert a new one; Delete a specific record by its id number; or Update using the id number.

Date and value entries are checked to make sure they are in the correct format.

CHALLENGES:

This was my first time using SQlite and I had a hard time understanding some issues, such as the logic of some SQL commands. Well, In general, SQL was very difficult for me!!

It was a painful challenge to create the logic to create new habits and track them. I spent a lot of time trying to build the basic system, but I had a lot of errors and difficulties.

I tried not to repeat the code, but it was impossible. There are probably many ways to do the same thing much better or optimized, but for now I worked this way. 


LESSONS LEARNED: 

The first item I want to highlight is that this exercise has really helped me understand how SQL works. I still have a lot to learn but I have been able to start to see a little bit of what can be done and the potential it has.

Secondly, I have also been able to start to better understand how to set up an application (even if it is as simple as this one). I think it has helped me a lot to understand how to separate a program, with their respective parts, as well as 

try to work in blocks. I think that one of the potentialities of this exercise has been to start creating in my brain the basic logics of design and operability of an application and its code.

Thirdly, the use of dates, as well as their manipulation. It has been very interesting to see how correct and incorrect formats can be established and how to use this way of proceeding for different data. 

Finally, I really liked this exercise. It has given me a boost in learning and has allowed me to take the leap to try to do things on my own, without tutorials. 


AREAS TO IMPROVE: 

.I am completely incompetent in git and github. I need to improve a lot because I don't understand how it works and it's slowing me down a bit in the progress of the exercises of this platform.

.I have to start thinking more about how to optimize the code and above all not to repeat so much. The block logic is starting to be internalized but I still have a long way to go to do things well and in a simple way.

.I need to learn a lot more, in all areas!!!


RESOURCES USED:

.Microsoft C# documentation.

.Stack Overflow.

.A lot of Research in google with specific problems.

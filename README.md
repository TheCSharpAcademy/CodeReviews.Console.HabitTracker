# Requirements

<ol>
<li>Log occurences of a habit.

<li>This habit can't be tracked by time (ex. hours of sleep), only by quantity (ex. number of water glasses a day)

<li>Users need to be able to input the date of the occurrence of the habit.

<li>The application should store and retrieve data from a real database.

<li>When the application starts, it should create a sqlite database, if one isn’t present.

<li>It should also create a table in the database, where the habit will be logged.

<li>The users should be able to insert, delete, update and view their logged habit.

<li>You should handle all possible errors so that the application never crashes.

<li>You can only interact with the database using ADO.NET. You can’t use mappers such as Entity Framework or Dapper.

<li>Your project needs to contain a Read Me file where you'll explain how your app works.

# Welcome to my habit tracker.
(The application will autopopulate at startup for demo purposes.)

## How does it work?
After the creatin of the database, the app will allow you to view your data, edit and delete entries.
In this app you'll be able to enter any habit by following the prompts as well as using custom measure units whether you want to track your bookreading, your writing or your bench presses!
## found a bug?
send me a pm on discord or leave a comment!
## What have i learned from this project!
Well for starters, i did this project with no SQL knowledge making this a true challenge for me, although i followed the instructions partially, i have found myself skimming through the documentation while i tried to figure out the last challenge for the project- a recap system- though i have a general idea on how i could do it, i dont have enough sql practice to write it yet, so i will come back later to this project to figure out how to do it!
